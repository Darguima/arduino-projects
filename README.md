Welcome to <u>Arduino Projects</u>, the place where I store all my electronic circuits, with Arduino, Raspberry Pi or even root electronic, without any microcontroller.

### Why I created this repository

You can find many blogs about Arduino and electronics on the Internet, teaching you how to use all sorts of modules or components. The idea here is not to teach anyone, it's just to have a place to document and store my projects, with images and the code.
